Developing a predictive model capable of accuratly determining the likelihood of a college basketball player being drafted into the NBA Team. 
==============================

• Project Overview: The project involves working with the statistical data of the college students playing basketball. In this learning task, the goal is to predict whether a college basketball player will be drafted to join the NBA league based on their statistics.

The annual NBA draft is a highly anticipated event where NBA teams select players from American colleges and international professional leagues to join their rosters. Being drafted to the NBA is a significant achievement for any basketball player, marking a transition to the professional league. This event captures the attention of sports commentators, fans, and enthusiasts who eagerly track the careers of college players and speculate about their chances of being selected by NBA teams.


• Dataset: The dataset provided contains a wide range of features that illuminate players' performance during their college basketball season.
The dataset comprises 64 players' performance attributes, including Games Played (GP), Minutes Played (Min_per), Offensive Rating (ORtg), Defensive Rating (DRtg), Field Goals Made (twoPM), Free Throws Made (FTM), and many others offer insights into various facets of a player's playing style and contribution to their team.

        Basketball Players Training dataset: train.csv
        Basketball Players Testing dataset: test.csv


• Business Problem: Build a Binary Classification predictive model capable of accuratly determining the likelihood of a college basketball player being drafted into the NBA based on their performance statistics from their records. The model's accurate predictions can provide valuable insights for both players and teams, aiding decision-making during the NBA draft process. Additionally, this model will offer valuable insights to sports commentators, fans, and scouts, aiding them in predicting the potential NBA draft prospects of individual players.

The primary evaluation metric for this task is the AUROC: Area Under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curve.

• The subsequent steps to be performed for execution of the project. 

1. Create a new local copy of a remote assignment 1 repository with below command.
    git clone git@github.com:MonaliPatil19/adv_mla_assignment1.git

2. Change the working directory as adv_mla_assignment1.
    cd adv_mla_assignment1

3. Set up a virtual environment, install the required packages using requirement.txt
    pip install -r requirement.txt

3. Install the custom package my-krml-package
   pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ my-krml-package==0.1.9

4. Execute the EDA notebook for week 2 and week 3. EDA and modeling is in same neetbook for week 1. 
   python Patil_Monali-14370946-week2_EDA.ipynb
   or 
   Patil_Monali-14370946-week3_EDA.ipynb

5. Once EDA for the respective week is completed, execute the modeliing notebook. 
   python Patil_Monali-14370946-week1_LR.ipynb
   or 
   Patil_Monali-14370946-week2_RF.ipynb
   Patil_Monali-14370946-week2_RF_Tuned.ipynb 
   or 
   Patil_Monali-14370946-week3_AdaBoost.ipynb
